## Marshall Kitani

Agenda I: Protect the colonists, you've got CCTV down on the cargo bay, also keep an eye on the the ship and it's 
    surrounding space. Find out more about the rest of the crew who have awakened with you.
Agenda II: Something funny happened in the cargo bay, the colonists are at risk, get to the bottom of the case
    wake your deputy who is sleeping with the colonists for the help.
Agenda III: Do whatever you need to protect the colonists, get to the radio, send a distress signal and get aid.


## Captain Brant

Agenda I: Try and solve how you can keep the ship the Simrugh flying another month (need at least 1 shift in the 
    captains quarters to balance the books) Keep Jack the UA Marshall from looking too closely at any of the ship's 
    equipment (especially the inoperative Shuttle, having only 1 shuttle is a very clear breach of ICC rules and the 
    Simurgh should never have left port).
Agenda II: The fuck, someone is risking the lives of the colonists. You are still in charge of this ship, 
    take command and sort things out.
Agenda III: Some people want off the ship, not you, if you abandon your ship for certain your corporate shareholders 
    will use the salvage costs to seize it from you. Your not really the going down with the ship type, but it sure 
    beats having no ship and a ton of debts.


## Pilot O'Neil

Agenda I: Check you are on-course, keep the ship together, help the captain, 
    do the shift with the techie try and get the techie fired.
Agenda II: Keep the ship together, deal with anyone who risks it
Agenda III: Look after the captain keep him safe, your lives are worth more than this ship


## Roughneck Bobby Peterson

Hand out the appropriate, agendas for II and  III

Agenda I: Do your shift, use it to plan a way to get down to cargo without detection, the Marshall had set up CCTV 
    covering the colonist's cargo bay, don't get caught on camera and find a way to distract him.
Agenda II: What the fuck, there was nothing in the pod just a dummy and some weird bug creatures, 
    one tried to attack you and the others run off. Better keep looking for that scientist.
Agenda II: You've done the hit, hide any traces of you being here and don't get found down here.
Agenda III: There's too much heat on this ship, escape on a shuttle.


## WY Agent Michiko 

Hand out the appropriate agenda for II

Agenda I: Avoid suspicion, find out how much influence you can exert on the Captain, make sure the mission proceeds 
    as planned, if needed use your WY influence to keep the Marshall in check while the colonists are UA citizens, 
    they are on a WY sponsored mission after all, oh and yes you've got some contacts in the ICC (owned and operated by WY).
Agenda II: Someone's been snooping around cargo, not good, do whatever you can to make sure the 
    Captain and Marshall deals with this harshly.
Agenda II: Recover the facehugger at all costs, don't let the crew learn you were smuggling it
Agenda III: Call in the WY dog team Delta2, Destroy the radio so nobody else can call the ICC, 
    if news gets out your career is toast
