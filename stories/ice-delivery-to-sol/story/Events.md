## Summary

### Act I Returning home

The ship has just arrived in the sol system, and the crew are awakened. It's approximately 1 weeks
to earth. A few things have gone wrong on the ship which should keep everyone busy.

A chance for the PCs to learn more about each other, apart from malfunctioning equipment keep
the stress down, it's just another routine run. Make sure Bobby is able to advance the story.
If it doesn't there are a few events you can start throwing.

#### Events

Bad dreams (req): Any of the crew who fail an empathy roll will have a nightmare:
* the captain will dream about money, and the ship turning into a giant evil vulture
* the pilot will dream about the blackness of space made physical and its hunting down the captain
* the marshall will dream about his last case, he's found the scientist but he's bleeding a lot
* the roughneck dreams about his last employers catching up with them and getting shot
* the WY agent will dream about being fired and having a baby growing inside her but it's not hers

Undercrewed rustbucket (req): having all the crew in cyro has not been good for the ship
    roll for D3 minor failures on the ship.

Event collision: space isn't quite empty the ship just hit something relatively large, probably only
    an ice speck, roll for major equipment failure or have something go wrong with cryo

### Act II Death on the ship

Bobby has either woken the Viggo the scientist, the facehugger or there is a small chance he's been caught. 
Make sure something is exciting enough for the rest of the crew to investigate.

Marshall Investigates: If Bobby is caught, there's going to be a lot of questions and a close look
at the colonists, perhaps the scientist and/or the facehuggers are found.

Acid: if the facehugger has spilt any blood, make sure it lands on something critical like cables
    or cyro pipes, don't have it fail straight away.

Cascading failure: Things should start going increasingly wrong with the cyro coolant and power supply
    by act II all the colonists should have woken.

Pager: If the facehugger pod opens then the agent will know about it.

Alien hunt: if someone was facehugged, they should eventually chest-burst and then the burster will grown
into a full alien. The full alien drone should be grown by act three.

### Act III high stakes

At this point the colonists should have woken, an alien should be amuck.

Bobby the roughneck if escaped his PC should take a new role.

Either the crew have called for rescue, or the agent has called for the dog team and smashed the comms.
Either way some of the PCs are not going to be happy about the soon to arrive visitors.

Depending on the number of colonists left aboard, the air left might be pretty limited.

The ICC inspectors: will have a lot of questions about the xeno or the sub-standard ship.

The dog team will capture or kill everyone on board, even the PC agent (the dog teams agent, wants to claim the credit
and besides, the the PC let things get badly out of control). The dog team will not risk showing up if the ICC
or the authorities show up, not in the Sol system.

Dog team: The agent can call them in but they a day out

Running out of time: If all the colonists are woken up the air scrubbers will be overwhelmed in
about 24 hours. Limited time to call for help (the nearest are 2 days out) or to fix some of the cryo systems
or evacuate some of them on the one working shuttle (3 cyro bays), has own scrubbers can probably take 10.
The other shuttle also has bays and scrubber although it's not going anywhere. With 26 of the colonists on the shuttles 
they bought themselves another day and enough time for rescue. The colonist supplies might the equipment to absorb
some of that CO2, and there are also oxygen tanks.

Alien on the loose: The colonists will slowly get picked off by the alien.
