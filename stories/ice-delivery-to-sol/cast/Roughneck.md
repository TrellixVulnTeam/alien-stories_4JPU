## Bobby Peterson, Roughneck

Full name: Robert Peterson
Job: Junior Technician
Age: 23
Personality: Mooch

New hire on the crew, you've done 2 jobs on this can of a spaceship, thought freelance work would be good but the pay 
is shit, and there are endless maintenance tasks. Do you best to avoid working.

At the last station you were approached by some underworld types in a dive bar, a hit job to take out one of the 
colonists in cyro, you've not done anything like it but the pay was too good to pass up. Even if you do have second 
thoughts about it, if you back out now you are a dead man, you've heard the stories, besides they were 
offering 40k with 20k up-front.

Your target is a male scientist called Viggo Kolwalski, he is hiding on the ship under an alias, you don't know or care
why they want him taken out. Your employers say he should clearly stand out on the manifest (the scientist won't look 
anything the roughneck colonists). Once you get to the Sol system, stage a distraction, take him out and hide the evidence.

Sounds challenging but you've a couple of ideas. The Marshall and the WY agent do not get on, if you can plant something 
on the agent and get the Marshall to investigate that would get his eyes away from the CCTV cameras. Another idea after the 
first shift(s) get a card game going and be generous with the drink, 
if you can get the Marshall into a drunken sleep great.
