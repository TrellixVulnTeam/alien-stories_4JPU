## Captain Brant, Independent Captain

Full Name: Oliver Brant
Job: Captain and co-owner of the Simurgh Company
Age: 43
Personality: Half crushed Free-spirit

You are a freelance captain (Ex Weyland-Yutani) with your own ship the USCSS Simurgh, being free of corporate should be
the dream, but it isn't. You are struggling to pay the lease on the ship, you are desperate for every job and if 
anything else major in the ship breaks you and your company are done for. The desperate need for money is the only reason 
you've accepted this WY job as it will take you to Africa Station, Earth, one of the busiest hubs in the galaxy, a berth
their will almost guarantee another job.

To make matters worse most of your crew and ex business partners have sold out, the only member of the crew who stayed 
is Gwen your pilot. The two of you own 40%, the remaining shares of the company now belong to various corporate 
entities, if these squabbling corporations finally agree on anything or one of the buys out the rest your company 
could be in serious trouble.

With the crew gone, you are down to a skeleton crew, the final bit of bad news is some parts of the ship are not up to 
regulations, the worst example is one of the two shuttles has no working engine. It should survive casual inspection 
but don't let the Colonial Marshall look too close. Coming out of hyper-sleep there are going to be lots of things
to repair, but top priority for you is the company accounts, balancing the books and checking the network for the next
job.
