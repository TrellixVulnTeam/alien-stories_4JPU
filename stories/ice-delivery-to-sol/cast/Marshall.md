## Kitani, Marshall

Full Name: Jack Kitani
Job: UA Colonial Marshall
Age: 56
Personality: Patriotic

You've had a long career as a Colonial Marshall as a detective. The last 5 years you've been stationed on the core world
colony of Heske 337, your last job was a farce hunting down a missing WY scientist Viggo Kolwalski. 
You got no leads due to WY stonewalling the investigation so they've packed you off to guard a batch of UA colonists on a WY sponsored mission, you're going with them, 
it's a retirement posting and the destination planet LV-946 has some pretty good conditions as far as colonised planets, so at least the job should be cushy and living somewhere which actually
has an outside will sure beat living in a tin-can.

You are an old school patriot of the UA, originally from Megacity Detroit. 
You don't like corporations, especially when they are interfering with the law.

The UA marshall bureau has an agreement with the ICC that you have a double role on the mission,
to ensure ICC shipping regulations and to prevent smuggling. You have a deputy partner who is asleep
with the colonists.
