## Michiko Nogumi, WY Agent

Full Name: Michiko Nogumi
Job: Weyland-Yutani Vice-president
Age: 35
Personality: Corporate Shark

You are VP of WY and board member of the Interstellar Colonial Logistics subsidiary of WY (don't get thrown by the name, 
it is cover for some pretty covert ops). Despite the power WY holds, there is still some red-tape which holds up R&D 
especially around moving biological samples to the sol system. You have devised a devilishly smart scheme. 

Colonists travelling via Africa Station Earth are pre-cleared all ICC customs checks and avoid all checks at the 
station, you have smuggled onboard two face-huggers in one of the colonist cyrosleep pods, the plan is to switch them out
at the station and onto another ship bound for Saturn. Get the living samples to the research station and 
promotion is a certainty.

The creatures have been put into hyper-sleep and the pod electronics engineered to spoof expected bio-signature of a 
person in cyro. There is a mannequin so even casual inspection of the pod's frozen window will show nothing suspicious.

As long as nobody tries to suspend cyro they will not be spotted, and on these missions colonists remain frozen until 
they reach the colony so nothing can go wrong! Just keep an eye on the crew especially the Marshall. Nobody can find out
about what you've smuggled, if outside authorities are brought in WY will disown you in an instant and their are very 
high prison times for people trying to smuggle dangerous biologicals into the sol system.
