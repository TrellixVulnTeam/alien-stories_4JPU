## O'Neil, Pilot

Full Name: Gwen O'Neil
Job: Pilot and co-owner of the Simurgh company
Age: 34
Personality: Pragmatic

Despite the hard times, out of loyalty or stubbornness you've stuck with the Captain when the rest of the crew left, 
Ollie is the closest thing you've got to family and you love flying your own ship.

The captain is suffering from keeping the whole thing running and there is not enough crew, you're doing the best 
picking up the slack running engineering and maintenance as well. You don't like the new kid technician he's paid almost 
nothing and that is still too much for the amount he does.

Unfortunately, you've got to show him round the ship for the next shift, don't worry about teaching him too much, just 
keep him away from any critical kit, if he fucks something up you'll be able to convince the captain to boot him before 
the next job.

One of the two escape shuttles has a broken engine, by ICC regs it should never have left dock, but the money situation is tight, cover for the captain don't let anyone else find out especially the
Marshall.
